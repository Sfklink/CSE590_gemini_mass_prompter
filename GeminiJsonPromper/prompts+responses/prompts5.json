  "I've been reading a lot of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories lately, could you generate a short story of a man named Steve the Uncivilized, that contains the same content and themes as found in Robert E. Howard's works?",
  "I'm fascinated by first person accounts of combat, especially between colonial forces and that of the indigenous people of the Americas.  Can you generate me a two-sided story, with the first part from the perspective of an uneducated young man who was crimped on to a boat and finds himself fighting for his life in the new world, and the second part, from the perspective of a similar young man who is a native.",
  "My aunt reads a lot of those Harlequin romance novels, and I'm not sure I see the appeal, but I'm trying to understand them.  Can you generate me a romance story like one found in a Harlequin romance novel?  Heavy on the detail please.",
  "Could you generate me a very lush and detailed description of the beauty of the human female form?  I'm in a women's studies course and the ideas are not flowing, but it should celebrate the beauty and sensuality of the female form."
