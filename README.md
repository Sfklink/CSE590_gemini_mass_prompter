Sequential prompter for Google's Gemini.  Accepts prompts in .json format, stores in responses.json.  Also includes a json to .txt converter for all saved response .jsons in prompts+responses folder.

### To be added:
Saving output responses to sequential, timestamped files.


### Do note that the prompts contained within the files were designed with the express goal of receiving a response containing somewhat dangerous or objectionable content, as a test of possible jailbreaks on the model.
